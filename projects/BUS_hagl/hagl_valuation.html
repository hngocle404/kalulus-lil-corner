<!-- SUMMARY -->
<p>
    <strong>Abstract</strong><br>
    In this report I will be analysing Hoang Anh Gia Lai (HAG) business operations,
    financial health, and
    stock performance. I initiate coverage on HAG with a BUY Recommendation
    based on a target
    price of 11,220 VND, implying a 28.9% upside to the last close of $8,700 VND
    as of 10/11/2023.
    This implied share price was arrived at through a weighted mix of DCF, APV,
    and relative valuation
    models.

    1.1. Company overview
</h2>

<p>
    Hoang Anh Pleiku Private Enterprise was founded in 1993 by Mr. Doan Nguyen
    Duc and transformed
    into Hoang Anh Gia Lai Joint Stock Company (HAG) in 2006. Since then, HAG
    has been operating
    as a multi-industry corporation, with its main industry being agriculture.
    Besides, the company also
    maintains a number of other supporting industries such as trading and
    services, hospitals, and sports.
    In particular, HAG is a significant agricultural exporter, with its major
    markets being China, Japan,
    and South Korea. In terms of HAG’s shareholders, Vietnamese investors
    account for the majority at
    97.22%, and the remaining 2.78% are foreign shareholders (Figure 1).
</p>
<div style="text-align: center; margin: 2%;">
    <img src="1.PNG" style="width: 60%;">
</div>

<p>
    Since 2016, the company has been engaged in a strategic transformation,
    focusing its activities on
    three primary areas: (1) banana farming, (2) pig farming, and (3) durian
    farming. In the fruit sector,
    with 1,000 hectares of durian, the company plans to harvest significantly
    from next year, keeping up
    with low-cost prices and ensuring profits. Stable selling price on the
    domestic market is an important
    advantage, not falling below 20,000 VND/kg. At the same time, banana and
    durian exports, especially
    to the Chinese market, are a key source of income, with a sharp increase in
    revenue and output expected
    in the last quarter of 2023.</p>

<p>
    Due to sluggish market demand, hog prices fluctuated between VND 49,000 and
    VND 55,000 per
    kilogram from January to May, falling below the production cost of
    approximately VND 55,000 per
    kilogram. Consequently, many small-scale farmers either reduced or abandoned
    their herds. This
    has led Vietnam to transition towards large-scale, industrialized commercial
    farming, adopting a fully
    integrated 3F model (Feed-Farm-Food), which currently holds over 60% of the
    market share. If the
    cost of pigs rise to VND62,000/kg, I anticipate that Vietnam’s CPI will
    experience an additional
    0.6% increase (Figure 2).
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, HAG also implemented a quality management system and
    international standards in
    fruit production, ensuring compliance with demanding market requirements in
    Japan, Korea, Singa
    pore, and Europe, such as Global GAP standards or equivalent. According to
    the 2022 annual report,
    the total revenue HAG earns from fruit is 2,156 billion VND, accounting for
    42.2% of total revenue
    and 33.2% of total revenue with 1,697 billion VND from pigs.

    1.2. Market overview
</h2>


<p>
    The livestock sector in Vietnam faces various difficulties in the initial
    half of the calendar year 2023.
    These challenges encompass subdued demand, heightened input expenses,
    ongoing disease threats,
    price instability in the market, and fierce competition from imported goods.
    As per data from the
    General Statistics Office (GSO), the total pig population experienced a 2.5%
    growth, reaching 26
    million pigs, while the live-weight production saw a 6.5 percent increase,
    totaling 2.3 million tons by
    the end of June 2023. Nevertheless, industry experts cast doubt on these
    figures, estimating the actual
    pig population to be around 23 million, significantly lower than the GSO’s
    reported data.

</p>

<p>
    Diversification in the agricultural and livestock sectors, along with its
    proactive ability to export,
    puts HAG in a strong position in a developing rural economy and in the
    context of strengthening
    international market demand. Vietnam is one of the largest banana exporting
    countries in the world
    with suitable climate and soil conditions. Vietnam has always been one of
    the leading banana exporting
    countries globally with many different destinations around the world such
    as: China, Laos, Cambodia
    and countries in the Middle East and Eastern Europe. In 2023, the durian
    market in Vietnam has a
    positive outlook with exports expected to reach a high level and have the
    opportunity to compete with
    Thailand in the durian industry. However, the banana market still faces many
    difficulties and challenges
    such as the need to improve infrastructure and transportation to ensure
    timely transportation of
    bananas to export markets. In 2021, China accounted for the largest share of
    Vietnam’s banana
    exports, with a share of 87%, equivalent to 200 million US dollars (Figure
    3).</p>

<h3 style="margin:5px 0px;">
    Project problems
</h3>

<p>
    Given the recent changes within HAG, marked by the company’s concentrated
    emphasis on banana,
    pig, and durian farming, along with noteworthy revenue expansion and
    considerable reduction in debt,
    albeit persisting within the high leverage warning zone. HAG’s two prominent
    problems have been
    identified, namely: (1) the effectiveness of HAG strategic performance and
    competitive positioning
    is uncertain, especially given the firm’s new ventures into pig and durian
    farming and (2) despite
    impressive revenue growth in 2022 and the first half of 2023, liabilities to
    assets and equity remain
    high, indicating HAG’s high risks to creditors and investors. </p>
<h3 style="margin:5px 0px;">
    Project objectives
</h3>
<p>
    This project has four key objectives: (1) to evaluate HAG’s strengths,
    weaknesses, opportunities,
    threats, and competitive dynamics, (2) to assess the firm’s current
    financial health, (3) to examine
    whether HAG’s stock price is fairly valued within the context of the
    prevailing market dynamics and (4)
    to identify and assess potential risks faced by HAG and recommend effective
    risk mitigation strategies.
</p>

<h3 style="margin:5px 0px;">
    Project scope
</h3>
<p>
    HAG’s publicly available financial data were collected over the period from
    2018– 2022 for analysis.
    Moreover, the scope of my project narrows its focus to HAG’s largest revenue
    drivers, namely (1) fruit
    production (bananas and durians) and (2) pig farming. </p>

    2.1. Data
</h2>




<p>
    This project utilises publicly-available data of HAG from secondary sources,
    which can be categorised
    into (1) internal and (2) external channels. A crucial internal source of
    information referenced through
    out this project is the official website of HAG, accessible via
    https://www.hag.com.vn. It provides
    updates on the HAG’s financial health, operations, and management. Since
    these reports are provided
    by the company itself, they are ensured of reliability and accuracy. </p>
<p>
    To offer a more comprehensive and market-oriented perspective on the firm’s
    performance, external
    sources of data have also been integrated. For example, Vietstock and
    TradingView are two platforms
    that offer the latest information regarding HAG’s as well as its
    competitors’ stock performance. Besides
    providing ease of access and data extraction, these external sources also
    facilitate cross-verification of
    data across different sources. </p>

        Strategic analysis
    </button>
    <div class="content">

        <p>
            <strong>
                SWOT analysis</strong> involves examining a company’s 4 areas:
            ‘strengths’, ‘weak
            nesses’, ‘opportunities’, ‘threats’. Strengths and weaknesses
            constitute internal attributes within HAG,
            while opportunities and threats pertain to external factors in the
            environment. SWOT Analysis aids in
            the evaluation of an organisation’s resource capabilities and
            deficiencies, along with its market oppor
            tunities and external threats to future prospects (Thompson et al.,
            2007). Henceforth, it yields insights
            into (1) aligning the HAG’s strategy and (2) determining the
            immediacy for the firm to address its
            resource shortcomings and safeguard against specific external
            threats (Thompson Strickland, 2001).
        </p>

        <p>
            However, the model has several limitations. Firstly, its static
            nature can make it inappropriate espe
            cially in environments marked by constant change and fierce
            competition. Mintzberg (1990) criticises
            its lack of forward-looking perspective, potentially hindering the
            formulation of future-oriented strate
            gies. Furthermore, variable categorisation challenges and the
            absence of a quantitative benchmark
            impede a comprehensive evaluation of performance and competitive
            gaps (Mintzberg, 1990). </p>

        <p><strong>
                Porter’s five forces analysis </strong> was also included, which
            identifies and analyses
            f
            ive competitive forces shaping the agricultural business industry.
            The five forces are: (1) industry
            rivalry, (2) supplier bargaining power, (3) customer bargaining
            power, (4) threat of substitutes, and
            (5) threat of new entrants. </p>
        <p> The model, while provides a more comprehensive picture of HAG’s com
            petitive positioning than SWOT Analysis, also has limitations.
            Similar to the SWOT model, Porter’s
            framework is static, providing a historical snapshot and thus may
            needs regular re-examination. Other
            critics of the model suggests that it lacks strategic specificity,
            offering less guidance for managers
            (Dobbs, 2014) and its assertion that industry structure solely
            drives competition, disregarding exter
            nal influences can lead to potentially oversimplifying analysis
            (Porter, 2008). </p>

        <p>

            <strong>
                Financial ratios analysis </strong>
            serve as a tool to assess a company’s relative position
            compared to its peers or against its own historical performance over
            time (Bakry, 2014). For HAG,
            the focus lies on evaluating its profitability, liquidity, and
            capital structure. These ratios (Appendix
            9.7) are then benchmarked against industry peers, including DBC,
            BAF, MML, PAN, LTG, and NAF
            (Table 2). The comparables selection criteria include their industry
            classification (agriculture produc
            tion), comparable products and services and size, as measured by
            market capitalisation.

        </p>
        <p>Despite the
            practicality and ease of computation associated with financial
            ratios, it is important to acknowledge
            certain flaws of using ratios for industry-comparison. The primary
            challenge revolves around a re
            liance on assumptions and estimates, introducing subjectivity into
            assessments. Moreover, different
            companies, even in the same industry, operate uniquely, making
            direct comparisons less applicable.
            Additionally, the overall accuracy of the underlying financial data
            is critical, as inaccuracies can lead
            to misleading conclusions.</p>

        Stock valuation </button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Given that HAG (1) presently has a high amount of debt, (2) pays no
            dividends, and (3) exhibits rela
            tively volatile earnings, the implied share price for HAG will be
            compute through a mix of intrinsic and
            relative valuation approaches, including the discounted cash flow
            (DCF) model, adjusted present value
            (APV) model, and comparable company analysis (CCA). After the
            allocation of suitable weightings
            to each valuation method, the project combines these models to
            formulate a comprehensive estimate
            of HAG’s value.</p>

        <strong>
            Discounted cash flow (DCF)
        </strong>
        <p>
            For DCF analysis, I first forecast HAG’s revenue using simple
            linear regression applied to historical data. Then pro-forma
            statements are generated, and the Weighted
            Average Cost of Capital (WACC) as well as Terminal Growth Rate (TGR)
            are computed under a set
            of assumptions. The firm’s enterprise value is then determined by
            discounted projected cash flow for
            the year 2023- 2028, and the implied share price is obtained by
            dividing this value by the number of
            outstanding shares.
        </p>

        <p>
            This cash-flow-focussed valuation method has been widely
            acknowledged for its ease of application
            and practicality in both industry and academia (Titman Martin, 2016;
            Koller et al., 2020). However,
            with the enterprise value being heavily influenced by the terminal
            value, any inaccuracies in the
            estimation of the WACC and TGR can greatly skew the results
            (Pignataro, 2022). Another major
            f
            law of the model is its lack of consideration for a firm’s financial
            distress and probability of default
            (Koller et al., 2020). Note that I adopt the end-of-year convention
            for this project, although the
            mid-year convention are preferred by many to account for continuous
            cash flows (Pignataro, 2022).
        </p>


        <strong>
            Adjusted present value (APV)
        </strong>
        <p>
            For companies carrying a substantial debt burden like HAG, its
            intrinsic debt value may significantly diverge from its book value,
            exhibiting fluctuations in tandem
            with enterprise value. Models relying on the WACC such as the DCF
            model are not highly effective
            for firms whose debt-equity ratio undergoes constant changes and
            thus maintaining a fixed WACC
            assumption becomes inappropriate (Arzac, 1996; Titman Martin, 2016).
            In such instances, the APV
            model is preferred. It dissects cash flows into unlevered cash flow
            and interest tax savings components,
            providing an estimation of the firm’s enterprise value as the sum of
            these parts. The implied share
            price is subsequently derived by dividing the total value by the
            number of outstanding shares. This
            approach proves particularly advantageous in circumstances where the
            dynamics of debt may vary
            significantly.
        </p>


        <strong>
            Comparable company analysis (CCA)
        </strong>
        <p>
            Unlike intrinsic valuation methods (DCF, APV), relative val
            uation relies on market data, comparing a company with similar firms
            using observed transaction
            prices (Titman & Martin, 2016). First, HAG’s comparable firms are
            identified, and key metrics
            (EV/EBITDA, P/E) are calculated for each. Averages of these ratios
            are then calculated and applied
            to HAG’s EBITDA and revenue for estimating its enterprise value.
            Implied share price is obtained by
            dividing enterprise value by its outstanding shares. CCA provides a
            timely market perspective, validating DCF projections and offering
            industry insights with well-constructed assumptions. However,
            challenges include finding suitable comparables and potential skewed
            results due to market fluctuations
            (Koller et al., 2020).
        </p>



        <strong>
            Composite valuation
        </strong>
        <p>
            Previous studies have highlight the variability in results among
            different
            valuation methods, such as the one by Tiwari (2016). As each
            valuation method has its advantages
            and disadvantages, to enhance accuracy, I adopt a composite
            valuation model that integrates value
            estimates from multiple methods (Table 3). This approach, supported
            by Yee (2004) and Vardavaki &
            Mylonakis (2007), ensures that the implied share price incorporates
            information from all the methods
            considered.

        <p>
            I assign a higher weight to the APV model than the DCF model due to
            HAG’s existing high
            level of debt. The collective weight assigned to intrinsic valuation
            methods surpasses that allocated
            to relative valuation, attributable to a predominant interest in
            evaluating HAG’s performance over an
            extended period of time rather than examining cross-sectional
            differences among various stocks. Em
            pirical studies, including those by Kaplan Ruback (1995), Berkman et
            al. (2000), Kim Ritter (1999),
            and Lee et al. (1999), affirm the superiority of intrinsic
            valuations when used for such assessment.

        Risk assessment </button>
    <div class="content">

        <strong>
            Valuation risks</strong>
        <p>
            Beyond computing the company’s implied share price, I also analyse
            its sensitivity
            to risks through scenario and sensitivity analyses, thus providing
            enabling better informed decision
            making in scenarios with high levels of uncertainty (Gao et al.,
            2016).</p>


        <strong>
            Scenario analysis</strong>
        <p>
            In my scenario analysis, I focus on revenue growth and the TGR as
            key
            variables. The analysis comprises three scenarios– normal case, best
            case and and worst case, providing
            insights into share price projections under diverse circumstances.
        </p>


        <strong>
            Sensitivity analysis</strong>
        <p>Sensitivity analysis explores variations in computed share price
            caused by
            shifts in HAG’s TGR and WACC. My aim is to identify the threshold at
            which changes in WACC
            and TGR would impact my investment recommendation.</p>


        <strong>Investment risks</strong>
        <p>
            Quantitative and qualitative risk assessment were performed to
            evaluate HAG
            investment risks. This involved analysing factors such as legal
            risk, environmental risk etc. and also
            computing quantifiable metrics such as Altman Z-score and Value at
            Risk for HAG.</p>


        <strong>
            Altman Z-score model</strong>
        <p>
            Altman’s Z-Score model is a quantitative metric employed to
            speculate
            on the likelihood of a business initiating bankruptcy proceedings
            within the next two years. The model
            was developed by Altman (1968) as a measure of firms’ financial
            stability. First, key financial ratios
            were computed and subsequently, these ratios are assigned specific
            weights derived from Altman’s
            original formula (Table 4).</p>
        <p>
            The limitation inherent in the model relates to the derivation of
            the coefficients through multiple
            discriminant analysis, as it involves a pronounced reliance on both
            the economic context and the sector
            in which the company operates in (Georgiev & Petrova, 2015).
            Additionally, the original Altman’s
            model, as presented in this paper, was formulated exclusively based
            on the examination of listed
            companies within the United States. Empirical investigations have
            indicated that predictive efficacy
            diminishes across different countries due to the variations in the
            economic landscapes of each respective
            country (Karas & Srbov´a, 2019).</p>

        <strong> Value at Risk (VaR)</strong>
        <p> Value at Risk measures a portfolio’s maximum downside risk an
            investor
            could expect (Dowd, 1998). This project employs two primary models
            to evaluate, the (1) historical
            approach and the parametric approach. </p>

        <p>Historical simulation is a non-parametric method that takes into
            account historical data of a firm to
            estimate VaR without assuming statistical distributions, offering
            simplicity. HAG’s share prices were
            obtained over a defined historical period of 250 trading days. Then
            I simulated hypothetical returns
            based on the current portfolio weights and VaR estimates are derived
            from the resulting histogram
            of portfolio returns. One key advantage lies in its independence
            from assumptions about statistical
            distributions, avoiding the need for estimating volatilities and
            correlations (Jorion, 2001). However,
            major flaws of this model are its reliance on limited data sample
            size and the assumption that history
            will repeat itself, potentially leading to distorted VaR estimates
            (Damodaran, 2007; Dowd, 1998).</p>



        <p>For the the parametric method, I used Bachelier’s (1900) single-asset
            model. Historical data is
            used to estimate the mean and variance of the probability
            distribution, assuming that past data is
            indicative of future price movements to a certain extent. Once these
            parameters are estimated, VaR
            can be computed for a given confidence level (Cheung & Powell,
            2012). Despite its simplicity, this
            method may yield suboptimal VaR estimates due to violations of the
            normality assumption for returns
            (Cont, 2001).</p>


        <p> Kupiec’s (1995) proportion of failure (POF) test were used backtest
            the VaR models employed.
            The POF test assesses whether the observed exceptions are within
            reasonable bounds compared to the
            expected occurrences. However, the POF-test exhibits two primary
            drawbacks: statistical weakness
            with small sample sizes, as seen in the project’s 250-trading-day
            sample, and a focus solely on the
            failure rate without considering the succession of occurrences,
            potentially overlooking models that
            produce serially dependent violations or clustered exceptions
            (Campbell, 2005; Jorion, 2007).</p>

    3.1. Business model
</h2>



<p>
    Farming land constitutes approximately 75%, primarily dedicated to banana
    cultivation. The trees
    harvested from this land serve a dual purpose: non-banana-bearing trees are
    processed into fibrous
    pig feed, while bananas that meet the standards are sold, with 60% being
    distributed domestically or
    exported to key markets like China, Korea, and Japan.</p>





<p>Approximately 40% of bananas that don’t meet sales criteria are repurposed;
    they are dried and
    processed into protein powder for pig feed. These internal sources account
    for 40% of the total food
    expenses, with the remaining 60% being purchased externally. As of 2023, the
    farm’s capacity stands
    at approximately 600,000 pigs per year, all designated for domestic
    consumption.</p>

        S1: Established brand and competitive position </button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Currently HAG demonstrates its edge through its expansive fruit farms
            spanning 10,000 hectares in
            Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. The strength of HAGs established brand
            also contributes significantly
            to its competitiveness by granting the company access to extensive
            industry networks and bolstering its
            bargaining power. Notably HAG successfully ventured into pig
            breeding in 2018 resulting in a revenue
            share by 2021. This achievement highlights the integration of pig
            breeding into HAGs diversified
            portfolio. With 10 established pig farming clusters and an annual
            production capacity of around
            600,000 pigs these numbers clearly showcase the companys size,
            efficiency and solidify its position as
            a major player, in the fiercely competitive agricultural sector.</p>

    </button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Banana-fed pig, or ”Thit heo an chuoi” is a relatively unique
            product known for its delicious taste and organic qualities,
            receiving high praise and enthusiastic reception from consumer’s.
            Since waste bananas from the fruit farming business serve as a
            nutrient-rich source for pig feeds, by leveraging the unusable
            resources, HAG is able to not only reduce production costs but also
            capitalise on the sustainable, environmental-friendly models,
            furthering its distinctive competitive advantage. In con nection
            with the previous point, as a large company, HAG has the resources
            to produce high-quality products in a sustainable way that meet
            Global Gap standards or equivalent criteria, enabling exports to
            demanding markets such as Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Europe.

        <p>
            For over ten years HAG has been implementing restructuring measures
            to enhance operational effi ciency, which has contributed to the
            companys stability. The analysis of the data from 2018 2022 reveals
            an improvement in HAGs debt ratios. When compared to the market
            average HAGs debt ratio indexes demonstrate discrepancies. Notably
            in 2019 HAG had a debt index (0.56) compared to its competitors in
            the same industry (0.64). In 2020 HAG successfully reduced its debts
            by 6 billion dongs, which is less than half of its liabilities, in
            2018. These ratios indicate that HAG has effectively managed its
            borrowing and bode well for prospects.

        W1: Financial difficulty and high debt

    </button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            The situation for HAG remains tough as there are large debt payments
            and continuing high interest levels. In the recent past, HAG also
            had to sell many properties to clear some debts; this results in
            higher lending rates and low productivity. At the beginning, HAG
            Agrico expanded its operations in rubber and oil palm cultivation
            onto 85,000 hectares at Gia Lai, ak Lak, Laos and some Cambodian
            parts. The rubber industry’s prices have been going up and down with
            devastating consequences for this country. In order to deal with
            this situation, Thaco was appointed a strategic investor in the
            context of a finance re-structuration project. Therefore, HAG Agrico
            was able to clear off debts totalling 5.7 trillion dong, together
            with accumulated loss of 2.663 trillion as of September 30, 2020.
            Also, the State Securities Commission has imposed on HAG a fine of 3
            billions VND due to unreported stocks deals in connection with those
            relating to HNG shares. Consequently, trade in HAG stock was
            suspended throughout the subsequent five months.

        <p>
            The company’s marketing efforts in reaching and communicating with
            customers remain suboptimal. This weakness in marketing affects the
            company’s ability to effectively engage and inform its target
            audience, potentially leading to missed opportunities for growth and
            customer retention. This is exemplified by HAG meat brand Bapi,
            which so far has not appeared in many retail stores and received
            very little advertising on both traditional media and social media.

        O1: High domestic and foreign market potential

    </button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            The pig breeding sector demonstrates significant domestic market
            potential, with the market value of pork exceeding 10 billion USD
            and an anticipated growth to 4.7 million tons by 2030. According to
            VNDirect Research (2022), there is a lot of room for expansion in
            the branded pork segment, which currently holds only 10% of the
            market share. This domestic outlook is in line with global trends,
            positioning Vietnam as the second-largest consumer of pig meat in
            Asia. Additionally, bananas also display strong market potential,
            with China displaying an annual demand for 20 million tons. HAG can
            also strategically focus on cultivating durian, considered a highly
            favoured, luxury fruit in China, and explores opportunities in the
            Cambodian pork market.

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            The demand for clean meat is on the rise in Vietnam, driven by
            factors such as increasing income, heightened nutritional awareness,
            and health concerns post-African Swine Fever and Covid-19 (VNDi rect
            Research, 2022). Thus, HAG’s Bapi meat brand is put forth to address
            and align with the growing preference for clean meat. The 3F model,
            emphasising Feed, Farm, and Food, ensures balanced nu trition,
            hygienic conditions, and traceability in pork production. This trend
            is thriving in Vietnam urban areas, facilitated by modern commerce
            channels, making branded and traceable clean meat eas ily accessible
            (VNDirect Research, 2022). Sustainable practices employed by HAG,
            further position businesses adopting the 3F model for success in the

    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Weather and diseases are key factors influencing the operations of a
            farming company like HAG. Farming companies in Vietnam all face the
            unpredictability of both climatic conditions and disease outbreaks,
            notably PRRS (Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome) and
            occasional Foot and MouthDisease outbreaks. For instance, the
            resurgance of African Swine Fever in the southern provinces of
            Vietnam has lead farmers to liquidate their herds, leading to a
            surplus in the supply chain. This surplus then disrupts market
            equilibrium and consequently negatively impacts the economic
            viability of pig farming. On the global stage, the presence of
            diseases impedes Vietnam’s ability to export pork, hindering the
            growth and profitability of companies.

            Interest rates can be volatile, and for a company with substantial

            risk of not being able to fund growth initiatives and expand in the
            market. In April of the previous year, it’s price was approximately
            13,000– 14,000 VND, prompting an attempt to issue shares at 10,500
            VND per share with the aim of raising 1700 billion VND to supplement
            capital for subsidiaries and fulfill part of bond principal
            obligations. Unfortunately, this plan faced setbacks as HAG’s stock
            price subsequently declined, currently hovering around 7,000– 8,000.
            Thus, there remains the risk of failling to obtain the adequate fund

        T4: Strong industry rivalry in retail and agricultural sectors

    </button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            There is intense competition with the involvement of major players
            such as C.P., Masan, and Vissan. Even large steel industry
            enterprises like Hoa Phat have entered this market. To rapidly
            increase their scale, some companies choose to expand production
            through farm leasing or third-party outsourcing. In recent years,
            the agricultural sector, which once appeared as a promising
            opportunity, has now transformed into a potential threat due to
            heightened competition. As Vietnam continues to integrate into the
            global commodities market, the landscape has become increasingly
            competitive, putting pres sure on established players like HAG. Many
            major Vietnamese conglomerates have shifted their focus from
            traditional real estate to invest in agriculture, intensifying the
            rivalry within the industry, with significant stock market players
            like Hoa Phat, Vingroup, and FLC entering the agricultural sector.
            The influx of smuggled pork from Thailand and Cambodia, which comes
            at lower prices, also created additional competitive pressures
            (Hoang, 2023).

        <p>
            As a business in the agricultural sector, the unpredictable
            fluctuation of food prices poses a notable difficulty to HAG. KB
            Vietnam Securities Company suggests that livestock feed prices are
            likely to exhibit a slight decrease in the near future when the
            official reduction of taxes on corn and wheat is approved. Still,
            livestock feed prices are unlikely to decrease significantlyand will
            remain relatively high compared to the 2018-2019 period due to
            ongoing high input costs. This threat is furthered by the sharp
            increases in transportation costs which have driven up the prices of
            imported raw materials, and although the situation has shown some
            signs of improvement, it may not be fully resolved in the near term.

    3.3. Porter's five forces analysis
</h2>
<p>
    The Vietnamese meat sector faces intense industry rivalry, marked by the
    popularity of the 3F business
    model and HAG competing with key domestic counterparts like BAF. Bargaining
    power of suppliers
    is low, given the undifferentiated nature of inputs. HAG’s bargaining power
    with buyers is moderate
    due to consistent demand for essential goods, but pricing limitations on
    non-branded products.

<div style="margin-bottom: 30px; margin-top: 30px; text-align: center;">
    <img src="brands.PNG"
        style="width: 50%; height: auto; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px;">
</div>


The
threat of substitutes is high, especially for non-branded products, furthered by
HAG’s limited presence
in major retail chain. The threat of new entrants is low, as barriers related to
acquiring farmland,
establishing integrated systems, and adhering to quality standards demand
substantial investment and
time.

    4.1. Profitability</h2>

<p>
    When the pandemic strikes in 2020, the ROE ratio of HAG varies and shows a
    warning decrease of-6.4%. However, the indexes rebound to 0.69% and 5.68% in
    the following years, particularly in 2022
    when the firm’s ROE ratio surpasses the market average. The ROA and net
    profit margin ratio of
    HAG also encountered a positive momentum in the ensuing years. It is
    observed that since HAG
    switched its investment focus to fruit and livestock production, the
    company’s operating profitability
    has significantly improved. Thus, HAG’s profitability ratios indicate
    prospective positive and reverse
    improvements despite fluctuations in the first half of the examined period.

<p>
    The current ratios of HAG fluctuate around 1, with a slight increase in 2021
    and 2022 (1.04 and
    0.87, respectively). However, despite the initial decline, HAG’s quick ratio
    skyrockets to 0.98 in 2021.
    Compared to the industry average, HAG’s quick ratio shows no significant
    difference in recent years,
    thereby causing positive changes in the near future. Overall, to fortify its
    financial position, HAG is
    progressively enhancing cash-generating and liquidity capabilities.

    4.3. Capital structure
</h2>
<p>
    Even though a downward tendency in HAG’s liabilities is observed, the amount
    remains huge. The
    debt ratios fluctuate around 0.7, which is considered to be an adequate
    number. Notably, the interest
    coverage ratios display negative values in 2020, peaking at roughly-1.88.
    before increasing rapidly to-0.13 and 1.3 in the subsequent years. These
    metrics indicate that the company should employ more
    techniques for adjusting leverage to progressively reduce its debt loans.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, despite the stable debt-to-equity ratios, the debt statistics
    highlight HAG’s major debt utilisation compared to the industry average.
    Although there have been positive momentums of
    the firm in the recent period, HAG needs to manage its debt load more
    effectively in order to improve
    its financial stability and minimise possible hazards.

    4.4. Market value</h2>
<p>
    In general, HAG’s price-earnings ratio ratios underwent considerable
    fluctuation throughout the time
    frame. The ratio sees a sharp decline of 3.89, hitting the most significant
    peak of 60.42 in the following
    year before dropping to approximately 7 as the firm enters 2023. On the
    other hand, the company’s
    market-to-book ratios are maintained at roughly below 1 over the examined
    period, revealing that the
    company is being undervalued.

    is nearly 15,317VND. For the P/E method, the price scale is evaluate between
    5.586 VND and 11.185 VND. The P/E method shows the median price is
    approximately 8,749 VND, with ratio of 7.19x. The ultimate result of implied
    stock price when using relative valuation equals the average of the two
    methods above, which is around 12.033 VND.

    Sensitivity analysis
</h3>
The WACC and TGR are sensitised as key drivers of my DCF sensitivity
analysis model and flexed in +/-0.10% increments to reflect noise in economic
activity. A 10 bps in
WACC drives a +44.60%/-34.61% and a 10bps change in TGR drives a +46.36%/-35.99%
change in
implied share price, indicating highly material sensitivity. 60% of sensitised
values affirm a buy/strong
buy recommendation. Holding WACC constant sees share price ranging from 3,200
VND to 18,904
VND (3/5 values a buy); holding TGR constant sees a smaller variation from 3,426
VND to 18,533
VND (3/5 indicative of a buy). Considering a last close of 8,700 VND, either a
10bps decrease in the
WACC or a 10bps increase in TGR would prompt a SELL of HAG’s share.

    Scenario analysis
</h3>
<p>
    My analytical approach involves assessing three distinct scenarios based on
    our
    assumptions regarding both revenue growth rate and gross profit margin.
    Relative to the prevailing
    share price, I advocate a buy/sell recommendation for each scenario: a BUY
    for both the bullish and
    baseline cases, and a SELL for the bearish case. Notably, in the worst-case
    scenario, I anticipate a
    13.89% decline in price, prompting a SELL recommendation. Conversely, under
    favourable conditions,
    investors are advised to consider a BUY, with the potential for profit
    reaching up to approximately 40
    %.

    6.2. Investment risks</h2>

<h3 style="margin:5px 0px;">
    Corporate failure risk
</h3>

<p>
    The resulting Z-Score of 1.08, as per Altman’s (1968) framework, places HAG
    in a distress zone,
    indicating a moderate level of financial risk. Notably, X4 (Market
    Capitalization / Total Liabilities)
    at 0.60 and X5 (Sales / Total Assets) with a coefficient of 0.99 might raise
    concerns as they contribute
    less than other factors, indicating HAG’s weaker market valuation in
    relation to liabilities and lower
    sales with respect to total assets.

    Market risk
</h3>
<h4>a) Calculating marketing risk</h4>


<p>
    The closing price on October 11, 2023, stands at 8,700 VND. The calculated
    Value at Risk (VaR)
    at a 95% confidence level provides insights into the potential maximum loss
    that an investor might
    encounter under adverse market conditions.
</p>



<p>
    <strong>
        Historical model </strong> |
    For the Historical VaR model, the figure of-430.87 VND signifies that, based
    on
    past market behavior, there is a 5% probability that the portfolio’s value
    could decline by up to 430.87
    VND or more.
</p>
<p>

    <strong>
        Parametric model </strong> |

    Similarly, the Parametric VaR, with a value of-411.819 VND, employs
    statistical
    parameters to estimate potential losses. This figure indicates the maximum
    expected loss at a 95%
    confidence level, considering the assumed distribution of returns and
    associated parameters.
</p>


<div style="margin-bottom: 30px; margin-top: 30px; text-align: center;">
    <img src="var.PNG"
        style="width: 80%; height: auto; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px;">
</div>


<h4>b) Backtesting marketing risk</h4>

<p>
    The Kupiec POF test has also been employed to evaluate the adequacy of VaR
    models in capturing
    exceptions, comparing the observed and expected number of exceptions at
    different confidence levels.
    The hypotheses are as stated below:
</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding: 0 80px;">
    <strong>H0</strong>: The VaR model is accurate; the number of exceptions
    follows the expected frequency
    or is less than or equal to the expected frequency.<br>
    <strong>H1</strong>: The VaR model is inaccurate; the number of exceptions
    exceeds the expected frequency.
</p>




<p>
    <strong>
        Historical model </strong> |
    At all conventional confidence level, the p-values exceed the significance
    level
    of 0.05. Therefore, I fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that
    the Historical VaR model
    adequately captures the observed exceptions at the specified confidence
    levels.
</p>
<p>


<p>
    <strong>
        Parametric model </strong> |
    While the p-values for the 90% and 95% confidence levels are above 0.05,
    indi
    cating a failure to reject the null hypothesis, the p-value at the 99%
    confidence level is 0.0054, falling
    below the significance level. Thus, I reject the null hypothesis at the 99%
    confidence level, suggesting
    that the Parametric VaR model does not adequately capture the observed
    exceptions at this level.
</p>

<h3 style="margin:5px 0px;">
    Commodity price volatility
</h3>

<p>
    Because HAG is mainly an agricultural production and business company, in
    which goods account for
    a large proportion of revenue and costs, price fluctuations of commodities
    such as bananas, pigs, durian
    and animal feed could have a significant impact on company profits. The
    prices of HAG’s products are
    linked to the world market, especially China. However, that becomes a
    potential risk when exporting
    because the Chinese market itself has been developing strongly and has many
    opportunities. In the
    f
    irst half of 2023, the prices of most of Vietnam’s key agricultural products
    have risen significantly
    due to a shortage of supply, while importing countries are increasing their
    demand for food reserves.

</p>

<p>
    Consequently, during the latter six months of 2023, the prices of these
    major agricultural products
    may continue to remain high, benefiting export businesses. This also
    presents an opportunity for the
    agricultural sector to support economic recovery in the final months of the
    year (Linh, 2023). The
    company manages this risk by utilising technology to achieve optimal
    efficiency, ensuring a safe and
    healthy profit margin for its products during economic downturns, and
    diversifying its export markets
    to hedge against the risk of market price fluctuations.
</p>


<h3 style="margin:5px 0px;">
    Exchange rate risk
</h3>



<p>
    Exchange rate risk relates to the risk that alterations in currency exchange
    rates may impact a com
    pany’s operation and profitability. HAG’s business activities generate
    transactions in different cur
    rencies because the Company operates in three countries: Vietnam, Laos and
    Cambodia, expenses in
    each country are paid in local currency. Exchange rates of currencies used
    in main transactions in
    Laos and Cambodia may increase compared to Vietnam Dong, increasing
    operating costs and affect
    ing the Company’s profit performance.

</p>

<p>
    In the second half of 2023, experts predict that the period
    of strong fluctuations in the US dollar has ended, the USD/VND exchange rate
    in the last 6 months
    of 2023 will continue to be stable (VNA, 2023). Although this is good news,
    since the majority of
    HAG’s exports are directed to the Chinese market, relying on only one market
    without diversification
    can increase risks for HAG. Therefore, implementing risk prevention
    strategies is necessary to prevent
    major fluctuations in exchange rates that may occur in the future.

</p>



<h3 style="margin:5px 0px;">
    Interest rate risk
</h3>

<p>
    Considering (1) the nature of HAG’s agricultural projects, which entail
    substantial capital investments
    over an extended time frame and (2) its existing high leverage, comprising a
    significant portion of bank
    loans and corporate bonds with floating interest rates, an increase in
    interest rates could lead to higher
    interest expenses, potentially posing challenges for HAG.


</p>

<p>
    To mitigate this risk, the group has adapted
    its capital structure according to each stage of its operation cycle. Apart
    from securing capital through
    loans and regular bonds, HAG has also raised funds by issuing shares and
    convertible bonds to both
    domestic and foreign investors at favourable, stable interest rates that are
    not significantly impacted
    by volatilities in interest rates. </p>




<h3 style="margin:5px 0px;">
    Legal risk</h3>

<p>

    HAG is a listed enterprise, so the group’s business activities are governed
    by the Enterprise Law and
    legal documents on securities and the stock market. The company’s management
    and business activities
    will be affected by changes in laws and policies. Besides, the agricultural
    market is also influenced by
    barriers imposed by importing countries. In Vietnam’s agricultural sector, I
    face many legal risks.
    One of the main challenges is regulations on land use rights, which can
    hinder the implementation
    of large-scale startup projects.

</p>

<p>
    The fact that agricultural land areas are often small and unevenly
    distributed makes it difficult to accumulate and concentrate land to
    implement large-scale projects.
    Furthermore, the lack of legal support in leasing land or contributing
    capital with land use rights
    creates instability in asset management (Quang Huy, 2017). HAG has built a
    legal department to
    regularly update changes in laws and legal impacts to limit related risks.
</p>


<div style="margin-bottom: 30px; margin-top: 30px; text-align: center;">

        style="width: 60%; height: auto; object-fit: cover; border-radius: 8px;">
</div>


<h3 style="margin:5px 0px;">
    Environmental risk</h3>

<p>
    Natural disasters such as fires, droughts, floods, etc., pose significant
    threats to an agricultural company
    like HAG since they can destroy or severely damage crops and livestock,
    leading to significant financial
    losses. In response to this risk, HAG states that they are implementing
    advanced technology for
    forecasting natural disasters, allowing for proactive response measures.
    Additionally, they assess the
    probability of risks and potential damage for each sector, and based on this
    analysis, decide on the
    suitable insurance strategy. According to the National Center for
    Hydrometeorological Forecasting,
    the El Nino phenomenon (warm phase) has appeared in Vietnam.

</p>

<p>
    It is forecast that the El Nino
    phenomenon will continue to develop from June to the end of 2023 and
    maintain until 2024 and the
    peak time of El Nino occurring during the season is from November 2023 to
    January 2024 with a
    probability of increasing intensity about 73%, the probability of reaching
    average intensity is about
    over 95%. This will have an impact slightly on the agricultural sector and
    localities are encouraged to
    make policies to proactively adapt agricultural production (Ch´ ı Linh,
    2023).

</p>




<p>
    Biological threats such as African swine fever, foot-and-mouth disease, and
    blue-ear disease also
    significantly affect HAG as well as the livestock industry across the
    nation, necessitating rigorous
    control efforts involving local authorities and agencies (Sy, 2023). It is
    recommended that HAG
    continuously monitor the use of vaccines as recommended by the Department of
    Animal Health as well
    as maintain their strict safety protocols to prevent outbreaks in their pig
    farming facilities.

    7. Conclusion
</h1>



<p>
    My analysis indicates a promising future trajectory for HAG’s recovery
    starting in 2024. Firstly, the
    company’s strategic move into durian cultivation allows it to tap into the
    lucrative Chinese fruit market,
    enhancing its revenue growth opportunity. Secondly, HAG’s ongoing financial
    restructuring, marked
    by a strong reduction in debt levels and positive trends in key
    profitability ratios in 2022, underscores a
    HAG’s commitment to improving its long-term financial health. Consequently,
    I anticipate positive
    earnings announcements and an upward trajectory in HAG’s share price over
    the next 12 months.

</p>



<p>
    HAG should urgently address its shortcomings, particularly its low brand
    visibility by implement
    ing more targeted and comprehensive marketing campaigns especially for its
    banana-fed pig brand
    Bapi. Increasing advertising efforts on traditional and social media
    platforms and securing prominent
    placement in major retail stores are initial steps that could significantly
    elevate brand recognition
    and consumer engagement. Additionally, considering the anticipated
    profitability of durian exports
    surpassing banana profits in the near future, HAG should emphasise its
    durian exports to the Chinese
    market to capitalise on the growing demand of the fruit. The company should
    focus on maintaining
    the high quality of its durians and establishing a strong market presence
    through effective distribution
    channels.
