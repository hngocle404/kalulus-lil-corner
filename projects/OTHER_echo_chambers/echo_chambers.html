  Introduction
</h1>


<p>
Paralleling the ubiquity of mainstream media is their profound effects on the current political terrain. Surveys have found that social media is now among the most common pathways where young people get their political and election news <span style="color: #888;">(Mitchell et al., 2020)</span>. This shift towards online news platforms provides those previously excluded from the political discourse in authoritarian regimes an opportunity to voice their opinions through the democratisation of access to information <span style="color: #888;">(Tucker et al., 2017)</span>, as well as changes society’s narratives about a future with more egalitarian ways of meeting and discussing due to disintermediation <span style="color: #888;">(Törnberg, 2018)</span>.
</p>  <p>
However, an increasing number of studies have found adverse effects of extensive social media usage on political attitudes and polarisation <span style="color: #888;">(Kubin & von Sikorski, 2021; Beaufort, 2018; Yarchi et al., 2020)</span>, which reignites the debate on the impact of selective exposure on one’s political viewpoint and the subsequent polarisation of those involved in politics on a wide scale <span style="color: #888;">(Iyengar et al., 2019)</span>. The primary purpose of this review is to examine the scholarly literature on the relationship between media consumption and political polarisation. It will first lay out the examination of evidence concerning the existence or lack thereof of polarisation directly caused by increased media usage for political research. Accompanying this discussion are brief implications for policy makers, educators, and media consumers on how to respond to the growth in polarisation across the political landscape.

  Echo chambers and the spread of misinformation: Drivers of political polarisation 
</h1>

<p>
Due to the increasing availability of niche and opinionated news programmes such as the Internet 
and ideological cable developing more entrenched political positions, great fear has been sparked with 
regards to segregation by interest exacerbating the gap between those who are politically informed and 
those who are not. Subsequently, this widening gap is found to increase political polarisation which 
leads to the reinforcement of political divides and threatens democracies by limiting political discussions 
<span style="color: #888;">(Boomgaarden & Prior, 2007; Sunstein & Vermeule, 2009; Ksiazek et al., 2010)</span>.  
</p>
<p>
Studies conducted in the US have found that Americans are deeply divided on controversial issues 
such as immigration, gun control and racial inequality. And of greater prominence in the scope of this 
paper is the fact that in recent years, the divisions regarding such issues are observed to have become 
increasingly aligned with partisan identities <span style="color: #888;">(Levendusky, 2009; Mason, 2018)</span>. Researchers often 
attribute America’s extensive partisan divides to a concept termed ‘echo chambers’ <span style="color: #888;">(Sunstein, 2001; 
Berry & Sobieraj, 2013; Prior, 2013; Bakshy et al., 2015; King et al., 2017)</span>.   
</p>

<p>
In the context of politics and news media, Jamieson & Capella (2010) defines the problematised phenomenon of an ‘echo chamber’ as “a bounded, enclosed media space that has the potential to both magnify the messages delivered within it and insulate them from rebuttal” <span style="color: #888;">(Jamieson & Capella, 2010)</span>. The magnification of hyper-partisan news is typically considered to be a preponderance of “attitude consistent information” (e.g., left-wing media consumers constantly seeking out information that supports their viewpoint) whereas the insulation against rebuttal is due to the “absence of cross-cutting exposure” (e.g., people on the right refusing to be exposed to centrist or left-wing perspectives that contradicts their pre-existing assumptions and beliefs) <span style="color: #888;">(Jamieson & Capella, 2010)</span>.
</p>

</div>



<p></p>
In other words, the extent to which the rise of social media as a dominant force in news distribution has led to the incurrence of greater isolation from diverse perspectives as users’ political outlook is isolated in echo chambers - information environments dominated by like-minded people. The proliferation of mainstream media platforms in recent decades, such as the spark in popularity of social media and the emergence of online news outlets as the main source of political information have undoubtedly caused a significant expansion of selective exposure to biased content <span style="color: #888;">(Garrett et al., 2014)</span>. Recently researchers have examined the parallels between polarisation and consumed news content, in which increasingly personalised and fragmented news, characterised by “the proliferation of more partisan-oriented media and by a more prominent tendency towards selective news exposure on the side of the audience” has been reported <span style="color: #888;">(Bennett & Iyengar 2008; Stroud 2010)</span>. 
</p>
<p>
Dubois & Blank <span style="color: #888;">(2018)</span> suggest that this significant change in the dynamic interplay between news media environments and politics can lead to segregation based on interest, potentially resulting in an unintended exercise of confirmation bias <span style="color: #888;">(Dubois & Blank, 2018)</span>. As echo chambers “limit exposure to diverse perspectives” and “favour and reinforce presupposed narratives and ideologies” <span style="color: #888;">(Cinelli et al., 2021)</span>, research has shown that echo chambers have the potential to become a serious threat to democracy by increasing extremism, social and political polarisation <span style="color: #888;">(Barberá et al., 2015; Mickey et al., 2017; Arbatli and Rosenberg, 2021)</span>. 
</p>
<p>
Facilitating the negative influence of echo chambers on the changing conceptions of democracy and media usage behaviour is the viral spread of digital misinformation. Even though propaganda has always been deeply entrenched in the political discourse, the deep and wide-ranging repercussions of these false campaigns have provoked critical public interest concerns in recent decades <span style="color: #888;">(Bradshaw & Howard, 2019)</span>. As those participating in echo chambers continually form groups and resist information that does not conform to their beliefs, they create a favourable condition for the growth of misinformation on the Internet <span style="color: #888;">(Quattrociocchi et al., 2016)</span>. 
</p>
<p>
Researchers at the University of Oxford have found that the number of countries using social media as a platform for their political disinformation campaigns has doubled in the past two years, with evidence of at least “one political party or government entity in each of those countries engaging in social media manipulation” <span style="color: #888;">(Bradshaw & Howard, 2019)</span>. A number of studies have demonstrated that the partisan divisions emerging from the amplification of misinformation not only impede compromise in the design and implementation of social policies but also have far-reaching and undermining consequences for the effective function of democracy on a broader scale <span style="color: #888;">(Erikson et al., 1993; Bennett & Iyengar, 2008; Fishkin, 2009; Achen et al., 2017; Sunstein, 2018)</span>.

Conflicting results in research on political polarisation </h1>


<p></p>
Despite the fact that there has been a significant number of studies reporting an increasing trend 
of political polarisation in digitally mediated environments <span style="color: #888;">(e.g. Arbatli & Rosenberg, 2020; McCoy et 
al., 2018; Grumbach, 2018; Layman et al., 2006; Hare & Poole, 2014)</span>, research into partisanship and 
political polarisation has surfaced conflicting results. This can be partly due to the multifaceted, complex 
and interconnected nature of social media, characterised by “complexity, non-linearity and emergence” - elements that reaffirm the difficulties involved in the disentanglement of the relationship between 
media and politics <span style="color: #888;">(Törnberg, 2018)</span>. </p>
<p>
According to research conducted by Tóth et al. <span style="color: #888;">(2022)</span>, while there is correlation between one’s 
news consumption and their electoral preferences, the evidence shows that this does not necessarily 
equate to the conclusion that people are insulating themselves from news outlets with opposing 
viewpoints. The data collected indicates that electoral preferences are in some cases correlated with 
more diverse media repertoires – i.e., individuals that identify as leaning towards one ideological end of 
the political spectrum also include counter-attitudinal sources in their news consumption ritual. <span style="color: #888;">(Tóth 
et al., 2022)</span>. Previous studies <span style="color: #888;">(e.g., Flaxman et al. 2016)</span> showed alignment with this finding which 
expressed a link between increased exposure to ideologically diverse views and greater ideological 
distance. </p>
<p>
Dubois & Blank <span style="color: #888;">(2018)</span> challenge the impact of echo chambers and temper fears of partisan 
segregation by putting forth an argument that there are limitations in “single media studies and studies 
which use narrow definitions and measurements of being in an echo chamber” because they fail to take 
into account the realistic context of multimedia environments <span style="color: #888;">(Dubois & Blank, 2018)</span>.  </p>
<p>
Other studies suggest that the evidence for selective exposure in traditional theories being the 
direct cause of political polarisation lacks conclusivity and consistency, especially given the high-choice 
information environment in the contemporary world. A number of studies examining patterns of 
selective exposure in an online environment found no link between exposure to partisan news and the 
polarisation among voters <span style="color: #888;">(e.g., Wojcieszak et al. 2021)</span>. Tóth et al. <span style="color: #888;">(2022)</span> also puts forth the notion that 
the extent of selective exposure in previous work on polarisation <span style="color: #888;">(cf Garrett 2013)</span> lacks certainty and is 
often exaggerated rather than investigated empirically <span style="color: #888;">(Tóth et al. 2022)</span>. </p>

Conclusion: The ways forward in a polarised world</h1>



<p>
The transition into a more digitised world of communication has posed significant challenges, 
specifically the exacerbation of political polarisation due to echo chambers and the spread of 
misinformation. However, due to the complexities arising from the 21st century multimedia 
environments, clarifying the causal relationship between increasing media usage for political research 
and aggravated ideological isolation has proven to be a challenging task as evidenced in the multitude 
of conflicting scientific results.   </p> 
 <p>
Political polarisation is a challenge likely to continue affecting society for the foreseeable future. 
However, studies have shown these challenges can be mediated through the collaboration and actions 
undertaken by those involved in the online political discourse, including online news consumers, policy 
makers and educators.   </p> 
  
<div style="margin: 30px 0;">
  <img src="2.jpg" style="width: 100%; height: auto; object-fit: cover; object-position: 0 20%; border-radius: 8px;">       
</div>

 <p>
Firstly, an improved understanding of the sources of polarisation and the mechanisms that 
exacerbate it is indispensable to the process of healing deep political divisions. Rigorous academic 
research into the ways media can aggravate or hinder political polarisation needs to be continued and 
ensured to consider the changing dynamics of the 21st century. </p> 
 <p>
Secondly, from a media consumer's standpoint, having a diverse media diet is a pivotal step 
towards addressing partisan bias. As suggested in research by Dubois & Blank (2018), the higher the 
number of media types chosen by an individual to be incorporated into their habits, the lower their 
likelihood of getting caught in an echo chamber. Therefore, individuals are strongly encouraged to 
approach political news from diverse perspectives, with practical steps including transitioning from 
passively encountering information with opposing viewpoints, to actively reading multiple sources or 
using other types of media for information verification (Dubois & Blank, 2018).  </p> 
 <p>
Thirdly, future attempts to reduce political polarisation on social media will most likely require 
policy makers and educators to actively and effectively foster media literacy. As aforementioned, 
scientific research indicates that individuals with greater media diversity are better at avoiding echo 
chambers (Dubois & Blank, 2018). Therefore, by suggesting that media users should not rely on social 
media as the sole source of political news, these media literacy campaigns can help people learn to avoid 
echo chambers. Higher media literacy would serve efforts in shedding light on ways in which society 
might combat echo chambers that exist for the relatively small proportion of individuals who neither 
engage in a variety of news sources nor are interested in politics.  </p> 
 <p>
It is an indisputable truth that mainstream media is not going anywhere and, at least for the near 
future, neither is polarisation. Understanding this politically consequential course of development is 
proven to be an indispensable part of addressing the global political divide.   </p>
