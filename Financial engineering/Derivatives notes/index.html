<blockquote>
<p><strong>Futures and forward contracts</strong> are agreements to buy or sell an asset at a certain time in the future for a certain price.
<strong>Futures</strong> contracts are traded on an exchange
<strong>Forward</strong> contracts are traded in the over-the-counter market.</p>
<p><strong>Options</strong> trade both on exchanges and in the over-the-counter market. 2 types:
1. A <strong>call</strong> option gives the holder the right to buy an asset by a certain date for a certain price.
2. A <strong>put</strong> option gives the holder the right to sell an asset by a certain date for a certain price.</p>
<p>[!quote]+ Example - option price chart
Suppose that a March call option on a stock with a strike price of $50 costs $2.50 and is held until March. Under what circumstances will the holder of the option make a gain? Under what circumstances will the option be exercised? Draw a diagram showing how the profit on a long position in the option depends on the stock price at the maturity of the option.
* Call = ability to BUY
* If high price, ill buy at low predet price. So spot increases (-&gt;) -&gt; boom at 50 PLUS premium -&gt; perk up profits
* Low price -&gt; no exercise -&gt; straight line lose at x = -2.5
![[Pasted image 20240114031854.png]]</p>
<p>Suppose that a June put option on a stock with a strike price of $60 costs $4 and is held until June. Under what circumstances will the holder of the option make a gain? Under what circumstances will the option be exercised?
* Put = ability to sell -&gt; good if prices go down
* At spot = 60 (-4 premium since holder) = 56 -&gt; exercise -&gt; profits perk up
* Spot rate higher than that (&lt;-) = profits = negative at 4, not exercised options
* Chart for the holder:

<h3 id="long-vs-short-positions">Long vs. short positions</h3>
<p>A trader who enters into a <strong>long futures position</strong> is agreeing to <strong>BUY</strong> the underlying asset for a certain price at a certain time in the future.</p>
<p>A trader who enters into a <strong>short futures position</strong> is agreeing to <strong>SELL</strong> the underlying asset for a certain price at a certain time in the future.</p>
<h3 id="otc-vs-exchange-traded">OTC vs exchange traded</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The <strong>over-the-counter</strong> market is a telephone- and computer-linked network of financial institutions, fund managers, and corporate treasurers where 2 participants can enter into any mutually acceptable contract.
* When a market maker quotes a bid and an offer, the <strong>bid</strong> is the price at which the market maker is prepared to <strong>BUY</strong> and the <strong>offer</strong> is the price at which the market maker is prepared to <strong>SELL</strong>.</p>
<p>An <strong>exchange-traded</strong> market is a market organized by an exchange where traders either meet physically or communicate electronically and the contracts that can be traded have been defined by the exchange.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="participants-in-the-markets">Participants in the markets</h3>
<p>Three main types of participants in the markets: hedgers, speculators, and arbitrageurs.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hedging</strong> = when it has an exposure to the price of an asset and takes a position in futures or options markets to offset the exposure.</li>
<li><strong>Speculation</strong> = the company has no exposure to offset. It is betting on the future movements in the price of the asset.</li>
<li><strong>Arbitrage</strong> involves taking a position in two or more different markets to lock in a profit.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hedgers</strong> are in the position of facing risk associated with the price of an asset.
 * They use futures, forward, or option contracts to reduce or eliminate this risk.</p>
<p><strong>Speculators</strong> wish to bet on future movements in the price of an asset.
* Futures, forward, and option contracts can give them extra leverage; that is, the contracts can increase both the potential gains and potential losses in a speculative investment.</p>
<p><strong>Arbitrageurs</strong> are in business to take advantage of a discrepancy between prices in two different markets.
* If, for example, they see the futures price of an asset getting out of line with the spot price, they will take offsetting positions in the two markets to lock in a profit.</p>

<li>This is because traders <strong>usually enter into offsetting contracts to close out their positions before the delivery period is reached</strong>. However, it is the possibility of final delivery that drives the determination of the futures price.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Closing a position</strong> = enter into an OPPOSITE trade to the original one that opened the position</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="contract-specifications">Contract specifications</h3>
<p>The most important aspects of the design of a new futures contract are</p>
<ul>
<li>the specification of the underlying asset</li>
<li>the size of the contract</li>
<li>the delivery arrangements</li>
<li>the delivery months</li>
</ul>
<p>The specification of contracts is an important activity for a futures exchange. The two sides to any contract must know</p>
<ul>
<li>what can be delivered</li>
<li>where delivery can take place</li>
<li>when delivery can take place</li>
<li>details on the trading hours</li>
<li>how prices will be quoted</li>
<li>maximum daily price movements</li>
</ul>
<p>Some contracts, such as those on stock indices, are settled in cash rather than by delivery of the underlying asset.</p>
<p>New contracts must be approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission before trading starts.</p>
<h3 id="convergence-of-future-spot-prices-arbitrage-opportunities">Convergence of future &amp; spot prices; arbitrage opportunities</h3>
<p>As we approach the delivery period -&gt; futures price coverge to spot price. Otherwise -&gt; <strong>arbitrage opportunity</strong></p>
<p>![[Pasted image 20240118155416.png]]</p>
<p>==If future P &gt; spot P==</p>
<ol>
<li>Sell (SHORT) futures contract promising to sell the asset at HIGH</li>
<li>Buy the asset at LOW</li>
<li>Deliver the asset to the futures contract buyer, earning HIGH</li>
</ol>
<p>-&gt; Since future inflow from selling &gt; spot outflow from buying -&gt; profit
-&gt; As traders exploit this arbitrage opportunity, the futures price
will fall.</p>
<p>==If future &lt; spot P==</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy a future promising to buy the asset at LOW</li>
<li>Wait until delivery</li>
<li>Buy the asset at LOW, cheaper than buying asset now at HIGH</li>
</ol>
<p>-&gt; Prices would consequently rise</p>
<p>If the <strong>futures price &lt; spot price</strong> during the delivery period, there is no similar perfect arbitrage strategy.</p>
<ul>
<li>An arbitrageur can take a long futures position but cannot force immediate delivery of the asset. The decision on when delivery will be made is made by the party with the short position.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless companies interested in acquiring the asset will find it attractive to enter into a long futures contract and wait for delivery to be made.</p>
<h3 id="operation-of-margin-accounts">Operation of margin accounts</h3>
<p><strong>Layer 1. Client &amp; broker</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Daily settlement / marking to market</strong>
* the broker will require the investor to deposit funds in a margin account - must be deposited at the time the contract is entered into is known as the <strong>initial margin</strong>.
* at the end of each trading day, the margin account is adjusted to reflect the investor’s gain or loss.</p>
<p>[!NOTE] Example: calculation
Suppose, for example, that by the end of June 5 the futures price has dropped from $1,650 to $1,641.
* The investor has a loss of $1,800 (= 200  $9), because the 200 ounces of December gold, which the investor contracted to buy at $1,650, can now be sold for only $1,641.
* The balance in the margin account would therefore be reduced by $1,800 to $10,200.
* Similarly, if the price of December gold rose to $1,659 by the end of June 5, the balance in the margin account would be increased by $1,800 to $13,800.
* A trade is first settled at the close of the day on which it takes place. It is then settled at the close of trading on each subsequent day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Layer 2. broker vs clearing house</strong>
When there is a decrease in the futures price so that the margin account of an investor with a long position is reduced by $1,800, the investor’s broker has to pay the exchange clearing house $1,800 and this money is passed on to the broker of an investor with a short position.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance margin</strong>
The investor is entitled to withdraw any balance in the margin account in excess of the initial margin. To ensure that the balance in the margin account never becomes negative, a <strong>maintenance margin</strong>, which is somewhat lower than the initial margin, is set.</p>
<p><strong>Variation margin</strong>
If the balance in the margin account falls &lt; the maintenance margin, the investor <strong>receives a margin call and is expected to top up the margin account to the initial margin level the next day</strong>.
* The extra funds deposited are known as a <strong>variation margin</strong>.
* If the investor does not provide the variation margin, the broker closes out the position. In the case considered above, <strong>closing out the position would involve neutralising the existing contract</strong> by selling 200 ounces of gold for delivery in December.</p>
<p><strong>Extra info</strong>
* Most brokers pay investors interest on the balance in a margin account, making the balance not represent a true cost if the interest rate is competitive.
    * Investors can deposit securities, treasury bills (at 90% face value), or shares (at 50% market value) to satisfy initial margin requirements, with subsequent margin calls requiring cash.
* Unlike forward contracts, futures contracts are settled daily. Daily gains or losses are added to or subtracted from the margin account balance.
* Minimum margin levels = set by the exchange clearing house, with individual brokers having the discretion to require more margin.
* Minimum levels depend on the variability of the underlying asset's price, and maintenance margin is typically about 75% of the initial margin.
* Margin requirements variation: Depend on the trader's objectives, with bona fide hedgers often having lower margin requirements than speculators due to perceived lower risk of default.</p>
<p><strong>Clearing house &amp; clearin margin</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Clearing house</strong> = intermediary in futures transactions, guaranteeing performance and having members who contribute to a default fund.
* Brokers, if not members, must channel their business through a clearing house member.
* Clearing house tracks daily transactions to calculate the net position of each member.
* Brokers maintain margin with a clearing house member, who, in turn, maintains a clearing margin account with the clearing house.</p>
<p><strong>Clearing margin account</strong>: Adjusted for gains and losses daily, with an original margin but <strong>no maintenance margin</strong>.
* Balance must be maintained at the original margin multiplied by the number of outstanding contracts.
* Clearing margin calculation: the exchange clearing house calculates the clearing margin based on the number of contracts outstanding, using either a <strong>gross basis</strong> (sum of long and short positions) or a <strong>net basis</strong> (offsetting long and short positions). Most exchanges currently use net margining.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="otc-market">OTC market</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>OTC market</strong> = where companies agree to derivatives transactions without involving an exchange.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Collateral</strong>
- Credit risk is inherent in OTC derivatives, and defaults can result in losses for the party with a positive net value.
- Collateral agreements between companies, such as A and B, are used to mitigate credit risk.
- Collateral arrangements may be one-way or two-way, involving the posting of cash or marketable securities with daily valuation.
- Two-way agreements may require <strong>posting variation margin</strong> based on daily changes in transaction values.</p>
<p><strong>Clearing houses</strong>
* Prior to the 2007 credit crisis, most OTC trades operated through bilateral agreements with collateral but had higher credit risk than exchange-traded markets.
* Regulators, post-2007 crisis, sought to reduce systemic risk by making OTC markets more like exchange-traded markets.
* Legislation mandates the use of <strong>central clearing parties (CCPs)</strong> for standard OTC transactions to reduce credit risk.
* CCPs act as <strong>intermediaries</strong>, becoming the counterparty to both sides of an OTC transaction and managing credit risk through initial and daily variation margin requirements.
    * CCPs are similar to exchange clearing houses.
    * Once it has been agreed between two parties A and B, a standard OTC derivative transaction is presented to a CCP.
    * Assuming the CCP accepts the transaction, it becomes the counterparty to both A and B. (This is similar to the way the clearing house for a futures exchange becomes the counterparty to the two sides of a futures trade).
    * For example, if the transaction is a forward contract where A has agreed to buy an asset from B in one year for a certain price, the clearing house agrees to
    1. Buy the asset from B in one year for the agreed price, and
    2. Sell the asset to A in one year for the agreed price.</p>
<p>=&gt; It takes on the credit risk of both A and B. It manages this risk by requiring an initial margin and a daily variation margin from each of them.</p>

* For example, if you observe a series of futures prices for different months, and as you move from near-term to far-term contracts, the prices generally go up, it indicates a normal market.
- Gold and live cattle futures prices follow an <strong>increasing function of maturity</strong>, known as a <strong>normal market</strong>; as you move from August 2012 to June 2013 in the contracts, the prices generally increase.</p>
<p><strong>Inverted market</strong> = Futures prices tend to decrease as the maturity of the contracts extends into the future.
* This means that contracts with later expiration dates have lower prices compared to those with earlier expiration dates.
* For example, if you observe a series of futures prices for different months, and as you move from near-term to far-term contracts, the prices generally go down, it indicates an inverted market.
- Soybean futures prices exhibit a decreasing function of maturity, termed an <strong>inverted market</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="delivery">Delivery</h3>
<ul>
<li>Most futures contracts don't result in the physical delivery of the underlying asset; they are typically closed out early.</li>
<li><strong>The potential for delivery, however, DOES influences futures prices</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Delivery period:</strong> = Defined by the exchange and varies across contracts.
- Investor A, holding the short position, decides when to deliver.
- Investor A's broker issues a notice of intention to deliver to the exchange clearing house, specifying the number of contracts, delivery location, and grade (for commodities).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Selection of delivery party</strong>
- The exchange selects a long position holder to accept delivery.
- Not necessarily the original counterparty (e.g. investor B); positions may have been closed out through multiple trades.
- The notice is usually passed to the party with the <strong>oldest outstanding long position</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Delivery process:</strong>
- For commodities, taking delivery often involves accepting a warehouse receipt and immediate payment.
- Costs associated with livestock care in livestock futures.
- Financial futures are usually settled by wire transfer.
- Price paid is typically the most recent settlement price, adjusted for grade and location if specified by the exchange.
- The entire delivery process takes around two to three days.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Days:</strong>
- First Notice Day: The first day for submitting a notice of intention to make delivery.
- Last Notice Day: The last day for submitting such a notice.
- Last Trading Day: Usually a few days before the last notice day.
- Investors with long positions aim to close out contracts before the first notice day to avoid the risk of delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Cash Settlement:</strong>
- Some financial futures, like stock index futures, are settled in cash due to the impracticality of delivering the underlying asset (e.g., a portfolio of 500 stocks for S&amp;P 500 futures).

<p><strong>Market order</strong> = carry out trade immediately at best price available</p>
<p><strong>Limit order</strong> = specifies a specific price -&gt; only execute at this or higher (if selling) or lower (if buying) to prevent loss/maximise profit</p>
<p><strong>Stop order</strong> = <strong>stop-loss order</strong> = slightly less favourable than market conditions - once limit is reached -&gt; market order straight away
e.g. market is currently 35, stop order at 30 -&gt; once it decreases if it hits 30 sell straight away
goal: close out a position if unfavourable price movements take place -&gt; limit the possible amount of loss</p>
<p><strong>Stop-limit order</strong> = order becomes a limit order as soon as a bid/offer is made at a price =/&lt; favourable than stop price</p>
<p>[!quote] Example: stop-limit order
* market is currently 25
* stop-order to buy = stop of 40, limit at 41
* the moment theres a bid/offer at 40 -&gt; limit order (buy immediately as long as it's not above 41)</p>
<p>[!quote] Example: a stop-limit order to sell at 20.30 with a limit of 20.10:
= as soon as there is a bid at 20.30 the contract should be sold providing this can be done at 20.10 or a higher price.</p>
<p>A <strong>market-if-touched order</strong> is executed at the best available price after a trade occurs at a specified price or at a price more favorable than the specified price.

<p>==Comparing market if touched and stop order==</p>
<p>Consider an investor who has a long position in a futures contract and is issuing instructions that would lead to closing out the contract.</p>
<ul>
<li>A stop order is designed to place a limit on the loss that can occur in the event of unfavorable price movements.</li>
<li>By contrast, a market-if-touched order is designed to ensure that profits are taken if sufficiently favorable price movements occur.</li>
</ul>
<p>==Examples==</p>
<p><strong>Stop order to sell at $2</strong> = used by investors - order to sell at the best available price once a price of $2 or less is reached -&gt; used to limit losses/protect gains from an existing long position</p>
<ul>
<li>if the market price falls to $2 or below, a market order to sell will be triggered</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limit order to sell at $2</strong> = order to sell at a price of $2 or more -&gt; used to instruct a broker that a short position should be taken, providing it can be done at a price more favorable than $2
* you are instructing your broker to sell your asset at a price of $2 or more, but not at a lower price

<p><strong>Shorting</strong> is the act of selling an asset that the investor does not currently own.

1. The investor instructs a broker to short a specific quantity of shares, for instance, 500 shares of company X.
2. The broker <strong>borrows the specified shares from an owner and sells them in the market</strong>. This action is executed in the same manner as a regular market sale.
3. At a later stage, the investor <strong>closes the short position</strong> by buying back the same quantity of shares in the market. These purchased shares replace the borrowed ones, thus closing the short position.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>No Transactions Costs:</strong> Market participants are assumed to face no transactions costs when engaging in trades. This simplifies our analysis and allows us to focus on the core principles of forward and futures contracts.</li>
<li><strong>Uniform Tax Rate:</strong> Participants are subject to the same tax rate on all net trading profits. This assumption streamlines our considerations, assuming a consistent tax environment across market participants.</li>
<li><strong>Equal Borrowing and Lending Rates:</strong> Participants can borrow and lend money at the same risk-free rate of interest. This simplifying assumption ensures a level playing field for market participants in terms of financing their trading activities.</li>
<li><strong>Arbitrage Opportunities:</strong> Participants actively take advantage of arbitrage opportunities as they arise in the market. This assumption reflects the proactive nature of key market participants, particularly large derivatives dealers, in exploiting profitable discrepancies.</li>

<h3 id="6-forwards-futures-prices">6. Forwards = futures prices ?</h3>
<ul>
<li>In theory, when there's <strong>no uncertainty about future interest rates</strong>, the forward price for a contract with a certain delivery date = the futures price for a contract with that delivery date.</li>
<li>However, in the real world where interest rates vary unpredictably, this theoretical equality breaks down.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Relationship btwn asset price, interest rates and contract types</strong>
1. When the price (S) of the underlying asset is <strong>strongly positively correlated</strong> with interest rates:
- Increase in S -&gt; immediate gain for a long futures position.
- Positive correlation likely -&gt; simultaneous increase in interest rates.
- The gain is invested at a higher-than-average interest rate.
- Decrease in S -&gt; immediate loss, but the financing is at a lower-than-average interest rate.
- Investors with long forward contracts are not affected by these interest rate movements.
    - =&gt; Long futures contracts are slightly more attractive than similar long forward contracts.
    - =&gt; Hence, futures prices tend to be slightly &gt; forward prices.</p>
<ol>
<li>When S is strongly negatively correlated with interest rates:</li>
<li>Similar argument shows that forward prices will tend to be slightly &gt; futures prices.</li>
</ol>
<p>Theoretical differences between forward and futures prices for <strong>short-term contracts are generally negligible</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Practical factors, such as taxes, transaction costs, and margin account usage, can cause variations in forward and futures prices not accounted for in theoretical models.</li>
<li>The risk of counterparty default may be lower in futures contracts due to the involvement of exchange clearinghouses.</li>
<li>Futures contracts may be more liquid and easier to trade than forward contracts in certain cases.</li>

<h3 id="8-commodities-ff-contracts">8. Commodities: f/f contracts</h3>
<p>Gold owners, like central banks, charge an interest rate known as the gold lease rate when they lend out gold. Same goes for silver. So, holding onto gold and silver can actually bring in some income.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Income and storage costs</strong>
- Consumption assets may lack income but have significant storage costs.
- Storage costs = similar to negative income</p>
<p>[!warning] Forward price of investment commodity
Without income &amp; storage costs: <strong>F = S . e^(rT)</strong>
With storage costs U (U = PV of all storage costs): <strong>F = (S + U) . e^(rT)</strong>
If U = proportional to price of commodity -&gt; treated as negative yield: <strong>F = S.e^[(r+u)T]</strong>
* u = storage cost per annum = proportion of spot price net of any yield earnt</p>
<p>[!quote] Arbitrage opportunity
Scenario 1: <strong>F &gt; (S + U).e^(rT)</strong>. Arbitrageur can:
* borrow S + U at rfr -&gt; use it to buy 1 unit of commodity &amp; pay storage costs
* short / sell a futures contract on that 1 unit of commodity
=&gt; <strong>profit = F - (S+U).e^(rT)</strong></p>
<p>However, as arbitrageurs do so, there will be a tendency for S0 to increase and F0 to decrease until equation above is no longer true. We conclude that equation cannot hold for any significant length of time.</p>
<p>[!quote] Arbitrage opportunity
Scenario 2: <strong>F &lt; (S + U).e^(rT)</strong>. Arbitrageur can:
* sell commodity -&gt; save storage costs -&gt; invest proceeds at rfr
* long/buy a futures contract
=&gt; <strong>riskless profit = (S+U).e^(rT) - F</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, equation cannot hold for any significant length of time.</p>
<p>This argument cannot be used for commodities that are not, to any significant extent, held for investment. Individuals and companies who keep such a commodity in inventory do so because of its consumption value, not because of its value as an investment. They are reluctant to sell the commodity in the spot market and buy futures or forward contracts, because futures and forward contracts cannot be used in a  manufacturing process or consumed in some other way. Thus:</p>

1 year futures contract, no income, coss 2$ per ounce pa to store gold, pmt made at the end of the year. Spot S = 1600, rfr r = 5% pa. Thus T = 1 (1 year)</p>
<p><strong>1. U = pv of all storage costs</strong> = discount cost at rfr
U = $2 . e^(-5% x 1) = 1.9
<strong>2. Futures price - theoretical</strong>

<p><strong>Convenience yield</strong> = the benefits or advantages an investor receives from holding a physical asset, like a commodity or stock, rather than a futures contract. It reflects market expectations on future commodity availability.

<h3 id="9-cost-of-carry">9. Cost of carry</h3>
<p>The concept of <strong>cost of carry</strong> is sometimes useful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Cost of carry</strong> = the storage cost of the underlying asset plus the cost of financing it minus the income received from it.</p>

<h3 id="10-delivery-options">10. Delivery options</h3>
<ul>
<li>In contrast to forward contracts, futures contracts often provide flexibility in the delivery period for the party with the short position.</li>
<li>The short position holder can choose to deliver at any time during a specified period, usually with a few days' notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Determining futures prices becomes complicated due to the flexibility in delivery timing.</p>
<ul>
<li>The maturity of futures contracts raises the question of whether it should be assumed at the beginning, middle, or end of the delivery period.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding when delivery would have occurred is crucial for calculating theoretical futures prices.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the futures price increases with time to maturity, it is optimal for the short position holder to deliver early, as interest earned on the cash received outweighs holding the asset.</li>
<li>In such cases, futures prices are typically calculated based on the assumption of delivery at the beginning of the delivery period.</li>
<li>Conversely, if futures prices decrease as time to maturity increases, it is usually optimal for the short position holder to deliver as late as possible.</li>
<li>In these circumstances, futures prices should generally be calculated assuming delivery at the end of the delivery period.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="11-futures-price-expected-spot-prices">11. Futures price &amp; expected spot prices</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>expected spot price</strong> = market's average opinion on an asset's spot price at a future time
- Futures prices converge to spot prices at maturity, prompting an analysis of the relationship between expected spot prices and futures prices.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Keynes and Hicks' Argument</strong>
- Keynes and Hicks proposed that if <strong>hedgers hold short positions</strong> and <strong>speculators hold long positions</strong>, the <strong>futures price will &lt; expected spot price</strong>.
- This is based on the idea that speculators demand compensation for the risks they bear.</p>
<p><strong>Modern approach - risk and return</strong>
- The modern approach links futures prices to expected spot prices based on the relationship between <strong>risk and expected return</strong> in the economy.
- Systematic and nonsystematic risks are considered, with <strong>SYSTEMATIC</strong> risk influencing the required expected return on an investment.
- The investment is essentially in the asset underlying the futures contract.
- If returns from this asset are uncorrelated with the stock market, the correct discount rate is the risk-free rate (r), so k = r.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE] CF to speculator
- Consider: a speculator taking a long (buy) position in a futures contract lasting T years.
- Objective: Speculator hopes the spot price of the asset will be above the futures price at the contract's end.
- Ignoring daily settlement, treating the futures contract as a forward contract.
- Speculator puts the present value of the futures price into a risk-free investment while simultaneously taking a long futures position.
- Cash flows to the speculator:
  - Today: <strong>F. e^(rT)</strong>
  - End of Futures Contract: <strong>S(T)</strong> <em>(where F0 is the current futures price, ST is the asset price at time T, and r is the risk-free return for time T)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Relationship between futures price and expected future spot price</strong>
- When returns are uncorrelated with the stock market, the futures price is considered an unbiased estimate of the expected future spot price.
- Systematic risk:
    * Positive correlation will tend to lead to a futures price lower than the expected future spot price.
    * Negative correlation will tend to lead to a futures price higher than the expected future spot price.
    * Only when the correlation is zero will the theoretical futures price be equal to the expected future spot price.</p>
<p>![[Pasted image 20240202200720.png]]</p>
<p><strong>Normal backwardation and contango</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Normal backwardation</strong> = when the futures price &lt; expected future spot price.
<strong>Contango</strong> = futures price &gt; expected future spot price.
- Note: These terms can also refer to the relationship between futures prices and current spot prices in certain contexts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we assume the capital asset pricing model is true, the relationship between the futures price and the expected future spot price depends on whether the return on the asset is positively or negatively correlated with the return on the stock market.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-9-options-markets-skipped">Chapter 9. Options markets (skipped)</h2>
<h3 id="basics-of-options">Basics of options</h3>
<p>There are 2 types of options: calls and puts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>call option</strong> gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset for a certain price by a certain date.
A <strong>put option</strong> gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are 4 possible positions in options markets:</p>
<ol>
<li>a long position in a call</li>
<li>a short position in a call</li>
<li>a long position in a put</li>
<li>a short position in a put.</li>
</ol>
<p>Taking a short position in an option is known as <strong>writing</strong> it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE] Terminology
<strong>At the money</strong>: the market is trading near the strike price
<strong>In the money</strong>: the option is profitable
<strong>Deep in the money</strong>: the option is very profitable
<strong>Out of the money</strong>: the option is in a loss making situation (for the buyer)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="options-exchange">Options exchange</h3>
<p>An exchange must specify the terms of the option contracts it trades. In particular, it must specify the size of the contract, the precise expiration time, and the strike price. In the United States one stock option contract gives the holder the right to buy or sell 100 shares. The expiration of a stock option contract is 10:59 p.m. Central Time on the Saturday immediately following the third Friday of the expiration month. Options with several different expiration months trade at any given time. Strike prices are at $2:5, $5, or $10 intervals, depending on the stock price. The strike price is generally fairly close to the stock price when trading in an option begins.</p>
<p>The terms of a stock option are not normally adjusted for cash dividends. However, they are adjusted for stock dividends, stock splits, and rights issues. The aim of the adjustment is to keep the positions of both the writer and the buyer of a contract unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="participants">Participants</h3>
<p>Most options exchanges use market makers. These are individuals who are prepared to quote both a bid price (at which they are prepared to buy) and an offer price (at which they are prepared to sell). Market makers improve the liquidity of the market and ensure that there is never any delay in executing market orders. They themselves make a profit from the difference between their bid and offer prices (known as their bid–offer spread). The exchange has rules specifying upper limits for the bid–offer spread.</p>
<p>Writers of options have potential liabilities and are required to maintain margin with their brokers. If it is not a member of the Options Clearing Corporation, the broker will maintain a margin account with a firm that is a member. This firm will in turn maintain a margin account with the Options Clearing Corporation. The Options Clearing Corporation is responsible for keeping a record of all outstanding contracts, handling exercise orders, and so on.</p>
<p>Not all options are traded on exchanges. Many options are traded by phone in the over-the-counter market. An advantage of over-the-counter options is that they can be tailored by a financial institution to meet the particular needs of a corporate treasurer or fund manager</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[!example] 2 reasons that the early exercise of an American call option on a non-dividend paying stock is not optimal.
<strong>1. Insurance</strong>
A call option, when held instead of the stock itself, in effect insures the holder against the stock price falling below the strike price. Once the option has been exercised and the strike price has been exchanged for the stock price, this insurance vanishes.
<strong>2. Time value of money</strong>
From the perspective of the option holder, the later the strike price is paid out the better. This is because the more delayed the exercise of the option is, the more interest the option holder can earn (since it is across a longer period of time).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Paraphrasing: <em>The early exercise of an American put is a trade-off between the time value of money and the insurance value of a put.</em></p>
<h4 id="why-it-can-be-optimal-to-exercise-us-put-option-early">Why it CAN be optimal to exercise US PUT OPTION early</h4>
<p>Short answer: as long as it is sufficiently <strong>deep in the money</strong></p>
<p>Bounds for European and American call options when there are no dividends</p>
<p>![[Pasted image 20240215155723.png]]</p>
<p>Variation of price of an American or European call option on a non-dividend paying stock with the stock price S0. Curve moves in the direction of the arrows when there is an increase in the interest rate, the time to maturity, or the stock price volatility</p>
<p>![[Pasted image 20240215155747.png]]</p>
<p>Example: consider an extreme situation. Call option; Strike price K = 10, share price S0 is virtually 0.</p>
<ul>
<li>if exercise immediately -&gt; immediate gain of 10</li>
<li>if wait -&gt; gain is &lt; 10, never exceed 10 since share price cannot be negative</li>
<li>Also 10 now is &gt; 10 in the future</li>
</ul>
<p>Put option: different from a call option in that it may be optimal for an investor to forgo this insurance and exercise early in order to realize the strike price immediately.</p>
<p><strong>In general, the early exercise of a put option becomes more attractive as:</strong>
* <strong>S0 decreases</strong>
* <strong>r increases</strong>
* <strong>volatility decreases</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE] Why the above?
The early exercise of an American put is attractive when the interest earned on the strike price is greater than the insurance element lost.
* When interest rates increase, the value of the interest earned on the strike price increases making early exercise more attractive.
* When volatility decreases, the insurance element is less valuable. Again this makes early exercise more attractive.</p>

<p><strong>Lognormal vs normal</strong>
- <strong>Short term:</strong> In the short term, the Black–Scholes–Merton model assumes that the distribution of stock price changes is <strong>normal</strong>. This means that over brief intervals, the percentage changes in stock prices are expected to follow a symmetric bell-shaped curve.
- <strong>Long term:</strong> As we consider longer time periods, the model assumes that the distribution of future stock prices is <strong>lognormal</strong>. aka <strong>IT'S NOT ST THAT'S NORMAL BUT NATURAL LOG ST IS NORMAL</strong>. This introduces a skewness in the distribution, and it better captures the asymmetry and potential for large price movements over extended periods.</p>
<ul>

<p>It is natural to ask what determines the shape of the zero curve. Why is it sometimes downward sloping, sometimes upward sloping, and sometimes partly upward sloping and partly downward sloping?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>expectations theory</strong>
* simplest
* long-term interest rates should reflect expected future short-term interest rates.
* More precisely, it argues that a <strong>forward interest rate corresponding to a certain future period is equal to the expected future zero interest rate for that period</strong>.
<strong>market segmentation theory</strong>
* conjectures that <strong>there need be no relationship</strong> between short-, medium-, and long-term interest rates
* a major investor such as a large pension fund invests in bonds of a certain maturity and does not readily switch from one maturity to another.
* The short term interest rate is determined by <strong>supply and demand</strong> in the short-term bond market; the medium-term interest rate is determined by supply and demand in the medium-term bond market; and so on.
<strong>liquidity preference theory</strong>
* most appealing
* Investors = prefer to preserve their liquidity and invest funds for <strong>short periods of time</strong>.
* Borrowers = prefer to borrow at fixed rates for <strong>long periods of time</strong>.
* This leads to a situation in which <strong>forward rates are greater than expected future zero rates</strong>.
* consistent with the empirical result that yield curves tend to be upward sloping more often than they are downward sloping
* Liquidity preference theory can be used to explain the interest rate term structures that are observed in practice. The theory argues that most individuals and most companies like to borrow long and lend short. To match the maturities of borrowers and lenders, it is necessary for financial intermediaries to raise long-term rates so that forward interest rates are higher than expected future spot interest rates.</p>

<p>A <strong>short</strong> hedge is appropriate when a company owns an asset and expects to sell that asset in the future. It can also be used when the company does not currently own the asset but expects to do so at some time in the future.</p>
<p>A <strong>long</strong> hedge is appropriate when a company knows it will have to purchase an asset in the future. It can also be used to offset the risk from an existing short position.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!example] It is May 15. An oil producer has negotiated a contract to sell 1 million barrels of crude oil. The price in the sales contract is the spot price on August 15.</p>
<p>Quotes:
* Spot price of crude oil: $80 per barrel
* August oil futures price: $79 per barrel (<strong>think what we're selling r gonna go down -&gt; wanna SELL HIGH -&gt; SHORT HEDGE</strong>)</p>
<p>The oil producer can hedge with the following transactions:
* May 15: Short 1,000 August futures contracts on crude oil
* August 15: Close out futures position</p>
<p>After gains or losses on the futures are taken into account, the price received by the company is close to $79 per barrel.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="32-basis-risk">3.2 | Basis risk</h3>
<p>Basis risk arises from the hedger’s uncertainty regarding the difference between the spot price and futures price at the expiration of the hedge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Basis = spot of asset - futures price of contract</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As time passes, the spot price and a particular month’s futures price do not necessarily change by the same amount and, as aresult, the basis changes. An increase in the basis is referred to as a strengthening of the basis and a decrease in the basis is referred to as a weakening of the basis.</p>
<p>![[Pasted image 20240329114341.png]]</p>
<p>![[Pasted image 20240329114401.png]]</p>
<p>Consider a company that uses a <strong>short hedge</strong> because it plans to sell the asset. If the basis strengthens (i.e., increases) unexpectedly, the company’s position improves because it will get a higher price for the asset after futures gains or losses are considered; if the basis weakens (i.e., decreases) unexpectedly, the company’s position worsens.</p>
<p>-&gt; <strong>short hedge = good if basis gap goes up</strong></p>
<p>For a company using a <strong>long hedge</strong> because it plans to buy the asset: If the basis strengthens unexpectedly, the company’s position worsens because it will pay a higher price for the asset after futures gains and losses are considered; if the basis weakens unexpectedly, the company’s position improves.</p>
<p>-&gt; <strong>long hedge = good if basis gap goes down</strong></p>
<p><strong>Choosing contracts</strong>
In general, basis risk <strong>increases as the 'time difference between the hedge expiration and the delivery month' increases</strong>. A good rule of thumb is therefore to <strong>choose a delivery month that is as close as possible to, but later than, the expiration of the hedge</strong>.</p>
<p>Suppose delivery months are March, June, September, and December for futures on a particular asset. For hedge expirations in December, January, and February, the March contract will be chosen; for hedge expirations in March, April, and May, the June contract will be chosen; and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Perfect hedge</strong>
- A perfect hedge completely eliminates the hedger’s risk.
- A perfect hedge does not always lead to a better outcome than an imperfect hedge; it just leads to a more certain outcome.</p>
<p>Consider a company that hedges its exposure to the price of an asset.</p>
<ul>
<li>Suppose the asset’s price movements prove to be favorable to the company.</li>
<li>A perfect hedge totally neutralizes the company’s gain from these favorable price movements.</li>
<li>An imperfect hedge, which only partially neutralizes the gains, might well give a better outcome.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="33-cross-hedging">3.3 | Cross hedging</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Cross hedging</strong> occurs when the two assets are different.</p>
<p>The <strong>hedge ratio</strong> is the ratio of
"the size of the position taken in futures contracts : the size of the exposure"
* When the asset underlying the futures contract is the same as the asset being hedged it is natural to use a hedge ratio of 1.0. This is the hedge ratio we have used in the examples considered so far. In Example 3.4, for instance, the hedger’s exposure was on 20,000 barrels of oil, and futures contracts were entered into for the delivery of exactly this amount of oil.
* When cross hedging is used, setting the hedge ratio equal to 1.0 is not always optimal. The hedger should choose a value for the hedge ratio that minimizes the variance of the value of the hedged position.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="minimum-variance-hedge-ratio">Minimum variance hedge ratio</h4>
<p>h is the slope of the best-fit line from a linear regression of S against F.</p>
<p>![[Pasted image 20240329115022.png]]</p>
<p>The hedge effectiveness can be defined as the proportion of the variance that is eliminated by hedging. This is the R2 from the regression of S against F and equals 2.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[!NOTE] Under what circumstances does a minimum variance hedge portfolio lead to no hedging at all?
When the coefficient of correlation between changes in the futures price and changes in the price of the asset being hedged is zero.</p>

<p><strong>Tailing the hedge</strong>
Small adjustment made to allow for the impact of daily settlement if we're using futures instead of forwards

Va = dollar value of position being hedged = principal x spot
Vf = dollar value of 1 futures contract = futures x size of 1 f contract</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[!quote] Suppose, for example, that a portfolio worth $5.05 million mirrors the S&amp;P 500. The index futures price is 1,010 and each futures contract is on $250 times the index. In this case,
* VA = 5,050,000
* VF = 1,010 x 250 = 252,500
* so that 5,050,000 / 252,500 = 20 contracts should be shorted to hedge the portfolio.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When the portfolio does not exactly mirror the index, we can use the parameter <strong>beta</strong> from the capital asset pricing model to determine the appropriate number of contracts to short.</p>

<p><strong>Why hedge an equity portfolio</strong>
* One answer to this question is that hedging can be justified if the hedger feels that the stocks in the portfolio have been chosen well. In these circumstances, the hedger might be very uncertain about the performance of the market as a whole, but confident that the stocks in the portfolio will outperform the market (after appropriate adjustments have been made for the beta of the portfolio). A hedge using index futures removes the risk arising from market moves and leaves the hedger exposed only to the performance of the portfolio relative to the market.
* Another reason for hedging may be that the hedger is planning to hold a portfolio for a long period of time and requires short-term protection in an uncertain market situation. The alternative strategy of selling the portfolio and buying it back later might involve unacceptably high transaction costs.</p>
